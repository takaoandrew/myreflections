What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It groups all of the files and directories in the current directory and starts a version control system. 
No commits are made.
This is necessary if you want to use git to track your changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to choose changes that will be commited in the repository.
This is helpful because you may not want everything to be added, only what is logical.
For example, I can only add the files in my app that are related to a change I am trying to make. 
These changes are added to the staging area. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
